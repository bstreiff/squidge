Random thoughts:

Levels need:
* Background tile layer
* Foreground tile layer

If all tiles are a fixed size (8x8? 16x16?) then we can build them into
one giant texture... I think Q2 had a system like that for small textures.

OpenGameArt has some sprites that would be useful:

   ... things like:

Goals?
* Should be similar to nethack: go through ~60 levels, get some artefact,
  come back, offer it.
* This will be online and multiplayer... what happens when someone hits the
  victory condition?
** Maybe we can just reboot the world?
* Perhaps we should reboot the world periodically to encourage players to
  not camp?
* Alternative idea:
** You (and others) descend to the bottom to achieve the MacGuffin.
** In retrieving the MacGuffin there's a Load Bearing Boss or something,
   and by getting the MacGuffin you now have to race back up to some
   'safe' level.
** Aforementioned levels are locked out until the MacGuffin is redeemed.
** After redemption, the MacGuffin is replaced, and the levels get
   regenerated.


Favoring lots of little maps connected to each other via
doors/portals/gateways of some sort, as opposed to Terraria's 'one giant
world'. Reasons:
* Smaller levels means we don't have to deal with fragmenting the map to
  send to clients.
* We can regenerate smaller levels piecemeal as necessary.


Implicit party system-- if you're near someone, then certain enchantments
and such will apply to other players. Kinda like Toejam and Earl. XP gets
shared too.

Levelling up... how will that work. Like Diablo, maybe? Or maybe like
nethack where STR/DEX/INT/WIS/CHA are determined by the same?

Death is permanent. Level requirements for gear will prevent the 'I died,
time for a mad drive for my old gear' that Terraria has.

Is there friendly fire? Gut feeling is 'yes' but maybe only 50% or so.


Player Inventories
* Slot limits?
* Encumberance? I like this more.

Equipment
* Counts toward encumberance
* Slot system: Shirt, Suit, Cloak, Left Hand, Right Hand, Pants, Helmet, Boots
* Items can be B/C/U just like nethack
* Accessories? Maybe just three slots?

Most monsters should use the same 'skeleton' as players
* Monsters should be able to wear armor, wield weapons

Object Identification
* Not crucial but doable... can be circumvented by other players telling you
  what something is, but maybe that's not so bad.


What nethack items would make sense?
* Most armor are probably okay.
* Lots of weapons are probably fine too.
* Artefacts?
* Magic stuff?
** oilskin cloak? don't think water will blank scrolls but prevents grab attacks?
** cloak of invisibility? seems plausable, could do 'invisibility' like TCoMI
** cloak of magic resistance?
** cloak of displacement? on being hit randomly 'shimmer'?
** helm of brilliance?
** helm of opposite alignment? would need to have alignments.
** helm of telepathy? could be used to highlight monsters in the dark
** jumping boots? maybe they increase jump distance?
** water walking boots seem less useful.
** scrolls?
*** identify? not sure if we'll have object identification
*** enchant weapon/armor? obvious
*** remove curse? obvious
*** destroy monster? obvious
*** confuse monster? could be done
*** fire? sure
*** food/gold detection? Probably less useful... could be used to highlight
    treasures though
*** magic mapping seems less useful
*** scare monster seems doable; makes all monsters flee you
*** teleportation seems doable
*** amnesia only works if there's object identification
*** create monster is doable
*** earth seems less useful
*** taming requires pets
*** charging seems like it may or may not be useful
*** genocide is overkill
*** not sure how punishment would work
**** actually punishment becomes hilarious with an appropriate physics
     engine...
*** stinking cloud could work
** what about potions?
*** healing/extra healing/full healing are obvious
*** gain energy is also obvious
*** see invisible makes sense
*** not sure how hallucination would work but seems plausable
*** sleeping probably wouldn't work
*** levitation could work
*** polymorph? not sure...
*** gain ability/gain level are easy
*** there are plenty to borrow from Terraria too...
